# Starting a Costech 4010 Run

***

Please contact the Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory Technical Director with any questions or clarifications. **StableIsotopes@ucmerced.edu**

***

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Samples are loaded into the *Zeroblank Autosampler* (see [Loading Zeroblank Autosampler](). 
- [ ] Costech 4010 is warmed up (see [Warming up the Costech 4010](../costech_EA/warming_up_costech.md))
- [ ] An isodat sequence has been created and saved (see [Setting up a Costech 4010 Isodat Sequence](../isodat/isodat_sequence.md))

*** 

## Introduction

An *Isodat sequence* file is required for all analyses on the Costech 4010 Elemental Combustion System. This guide covers the basics of setting up routine analytical sequences for this instrument. If you need to set up a specialized sequence (e.g., for method development or instrument testing) please consult the Technical Director.
