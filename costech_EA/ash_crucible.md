## Introduction

This guide covers how to change the ash crucible in the Costech 4010 Elemental Combustion system. The ash crucible or ash liner catches leftover ash and non-combustable material from sample analyses. It should be changed every 50 to 250 analyses depending on sample weight and material.

|  Sample Type   | Max Number of Analyses | 
|:--------------:|:----------------------:|
|      soil      |           150          |
|  soft tissue   |           250          |
|    plants      |           250          |
|  amino acids   |           250          |
