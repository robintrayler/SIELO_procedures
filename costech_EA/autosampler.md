## Introduction

The Costech 4010 Zeroblank autosampler has 3 different carousel sizes, a 32-well 50-well, and 100-well autosampler carousel. Different sizes can be used depending on the number of samples in analytical batch and the diameter of the tin capsules being analyzed. if you are uncertain about which carousel to use please consult the Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory Technical Director. 

## Steps

* Close the isolation valve on the autosampler drop-tube by turning it so the arrow is horizontal. At this point you should not be able to see the hot glowing column through the window on the top of the autosampler.
* Open vent valve in the middle of the autosampler. There should be an audible hiss as gas escapes.
* Loosen and fold down the three retaining bolts on top of the autosampler and prop up the autosampler lid.
* Remove the installed carousel by pulling straight up on the center of the carousel. It should slide out easily.
