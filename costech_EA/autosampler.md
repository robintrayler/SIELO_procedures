## Introduction

The Costech 4010 Zeroblank autosampler has 3 different carousel sizes, a 32-well 50-well, and 100-well autosampler carousel. Different sizes can be used depending on the number of samples in analytical batch and the diameter of the tin capsules being analyzed. if you are uncertain about which carousel to use please consult the Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory Technical Director. 

## Steps

### Remove Existing Carousel

* Close the isolation valve on the autosampler drop-tube by turning it so the arrow is horizontal. At this point you should not be able to see the hot glowing column through the window on the top of the autosampler.
* Open vent valve in the middle of the autosampler. There should be an audible hiss as gas escapes.
* Loosen and fold down the three retaining bolts on top of the autosampler and prop up the autosampler lid.
* Remove the installed carousel by pulling straight up on the center of the carousel. It should slide out easily.

### Install New Carousel

* select the appropriate sized carousel your samples (32, 50, 100).
* The autosampler carousel has an upper body with sample-wells and a base plate that spins freely.
* The baseplate has 3 holes in it. A center post-hole, a peg-hole and a sample-drop hole.

* The center post of the Zeroblank autosampler has a flattened edge that must be aligned with the corresponding flattened edge of the center-post hole on the carousel. 
* You must also align the peg and peg-hole to ensure the base plate cannot move during autosampler operation. 
* Since the carousel base plate can spin freely, rotate it so the flattened edge on the center-post hole and the peg-hole are aligned with the autosampler body. This takes some trial and error. 
* If everything is aligned properly the carousel should drop into Zeroblank autosampler body and the center post will be flush with the top of the carousel.

### Aligning The Autosampler

Now that a new carousel is installed you üö®**must**üö® change the autosampler setting in the Costech 4010 menu and align the carousel. Failure to do so will result in lost analyses. 

* Using the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è/‚¨áÔ∏è arrow keys navigate to the select autosampler menu on the Costech 4010 screen.
    * **If the buttons are unresponsive**, press `abort` and `enter` on the keypad.

* Use the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è/‚û°Ô∏è arrow keys to move the cursor to the `AUTOS 50/32/100` line.
* Enter the appropriate number in brackets `<#>` to the appropriate auto sampler size. 
    * `<1>` for 50-well
    * `<2>` for 32-well
    * `<3>` for 100-well
* Confirm your selection by pressing `enter`. The work `OK` should appear above the selection.
