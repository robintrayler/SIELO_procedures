## Introduction

The Costech 4010 must be warmed up prior to use. This takes 30-45 minutes. 

## Warm up the Elemental Analyzer

* Check if the EA is in `work` or `st_by` (standby) mode.
* If the EA is in `st_by` mode place it in work mode by pressing **work** and **enter** on the keypad.
    * *If the EA buttons are unresponsive*, press **abort** and **enter** on the keypad.
* Once the EA is in **work** mode make sure to place it in **remote** mode by pressing **remote** and **enter**. The Screen should read `REM` in the bottom right corner.
