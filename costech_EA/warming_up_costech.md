## Introduction

The Costech 4010 must be warmed up prior to use. It will take 30-45 minutes to warm up to operational temperature so you should do this at least an hour before you want to start analysis.

## Steps

### Setting Work Mode

* Check if the Costech 4010 is in `work` or `st_by` (standby) mode.
    * If the Costech 4010 is already in `work` mode stop here. 
* If the Costech 4010 is in `st_by` mode place it in `work` mode by pressing `work` and `enter` on the keypad.
    * **If the buttons are unresponsive**, press `abort` and `enter` on the keypad.
* Once the Costech 4010 is in `work` mode place it in `remote` mode by pressing `remote` and `enter`. The Screen should read REM` in the bottom right corner.

## Check for Automatic Standby 

If the Costech 4010 has not been used for a few days it might have automatic standby mode enabled. Automatic standby mode will pull the Costech 4010 out of work mode and into standby mode (`st_by`) after about 40 minutes if the system does not receive a signal from the computer.

* With the Costech 4010 in `work` mode press the `st_by` button to open the standby menu. 
* If `AUTOMATIC STANDBY` has an `X` next to it, automatic standby mode is enabled. use the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è/‚û°Ô∏è arrow buttons on the keypad to select `REMOVE AUTO ST_BY` and press `enter` to confirm. 
* Automatic standby mode is now off.
