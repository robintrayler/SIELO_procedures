## Introduction

The Costech 4010 must be warmed up prior to use. It will take 30-45 minutes to warm up to operational temperature so you should do this at least an hour before you want to start analysis.

## Warm up the Elemental Analyzer

* Check if the Costech 4010 is in `work` or `st_by` (standby) mode.
    * If the Costech 4010 is already in `work` mode stop here. 
* If the Costech 4010 is in `st_by` mode place it in `work` mode by pressing `work` and `enter` on the keypad.
    * **If the buttons are unresponsive**, press `abort` and `enter` on the keypad.
* Once the Costech 4010 is in `work` mode place it in `remote` mode by pressing `remote` and `enter`. The Screen should read REM` in the bottom right corner.
