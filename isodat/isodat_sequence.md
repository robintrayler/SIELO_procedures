## Introduction

An *Isodat sequence* file is required for all analyses on the Costech 4010, ThermoFisher TC/EA, ThermoFisher Gasbench II, and ThermoFisher GC-Isolink instruments. This guide covers the basics of setting up routine analytical sequences for these instruments. If you need to set up a specialized sequence (e.g., for method development or instrument testing) please consult the Technical Director. 

## Instrument Run Logs

Each instrument has an *Instrument Run Log* excel file located in `~/Box Sync/Instrument Run Logs/`. There are two log files, one for each Delta V+ mass spectrometer. **All analyses** must be entered into the appropriate *Instrument Run Log*.

Setting up an Isodat sequence begins by starting a new row in the appropriate *Instrument Run Log*.
