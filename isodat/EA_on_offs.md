## Introduction

Once the Costech 4010 is warming up (it doesn't need to be fully ready) you can start warming up the mass spectrometer. This is done by repeatedly analyzing pulses of the working gases CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> until the standard deviation of these measurements falls below 0.05â€°. These pulses of gas are referred to as on-offs.

## Staring Costech 4010 On-Offs 

* From *Isodat Acquisition* scroll to the *File Browser* and open the  `EA_std_onoff.seq` sequence. 
* Click the green **start** button at the top of the sequence. 
* Click OK on the `Options` window that pops up.
* The sequence should start
* Let the sequence completely finish. This should take about 1.5 hours.
