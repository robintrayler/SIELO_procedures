# Starting CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> 4010 On-Off 

***

Please contact the Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory Technical Director with any questions or clarifications. **StableIsotopes@ucmerced.edu**

# Prerequisites

- [ ] Samples are loaded into the *Zeroblank Autosampler* (see [Loading Zeroblank Autosampler](../costech_EA/EA_zeroblank.md)).
- [ ] Costech 4010 is warming up (see [Warming up the Costech 4010](../costech_EA/warming_up_costech.md))

## Introduction
Once the EA is warming up (it doesn't need to be fully ready) you can start warming up the mass spectrometer. This is done by repeatedly analyzing pulses of the working gases CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> until the standard deviation of these measurements falls below 0.05â€°. 

## Steps 

* From *Isodat Acquisition* scroll to the *File Browser* and open the  `EA_std_onoff.seq` sequence. 
* Click the green **start** button at the top of the sequence. 
* Click OK on the `Options` window that pops up.
* The sequence should start
