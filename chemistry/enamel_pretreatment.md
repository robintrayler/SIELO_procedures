## Introduction

This guide covers the pretreatment of bioapatite (enamel, bone) for Œ¥<sup>13</sup> C and Œ¥<sup>18</sup>O analysis[^1]. This guide assumes that the samples were collected using a dental drill or have otherwise been ground into a fine (flour-like) powder.

## Safety
Please review the Safety Data Sheets for 30% [Hydrogen Peroxide](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=BP2633500&productDescription=HYDROGEN+PEROXIDE+30%25%2C+500ML&vendorId=VN00033897&countryCode=US&language=en), and [Acetic Acid](https://www.fishersci.com/msdsproxy%3FproductName%3DAC423220025%26productDescription%3DACETIC%2BACID%252C%2BGLACIA%2B2.5L%26catNo%3DAC42322-0025%2B%26vendorId%3DVN00033901%26storeId%3D10652). When handling both chemicals, always work in the fume hood with proper PPE (minimum of nitrile gloves, lab coat, and eye protection). Be sure to store both chemicals in the proper labeled cabinets.

## Steps

### Preparation
1. Add about 5.0 mg of powdered bioapatite into 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tubes. **Label the tubes with the sample name**.

### Organic Removal

1. Add 1 mL of 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to each tube.
2. Cap the tubes and vortex to mix.
3. Leave the tubes with the lid cracked in the fume hood. Place a piece of aluminum foil over the tubes to keep out dust.
4. let sit overnight (~18 hours)
5. Centrifuge at 10,000 RPM for 5 minutes. **Make sure the microcentrifuge is balanced**.
6. Using clean glass pipette for each sample, discard the supernatant into a waste beaker. Be careful not to pipette the bioapatite. It is better to leave more liquid in than taking too much out.
7. Add ~ 1mL of DI water to each sample and centrifuge again at 10,000 RPM for 5 minutes. 
8.  Repeat steps 5 - 8 for a total of 3 rinses.

    - [ ] Rinse 1
    - [ ] Rinse 2
    - [ ] Rinse 3

9. Remove the final DI water rinse.

### Labile Carbonate Removal

1. Add 1 mL of 1 M Ca-acetate buffered acetic acid to each tube. 
2. Cap the tubes and vortex to mix. 
3. Leave the tubes in the fume hood with the lids closed. 
4. let sit overnight (~18 hours)
5. Using clean glass pipette for each sample, discard the supernatant into a waste beaker. Be careful not to pipette the bioapatite. It is better to leave more liquid in than taking too much out.
6. Add ~ 1mL of DI water to each sample and centrifuge again at 10,000 RPM for 5 minutes. 
7.  Repeat steps 5 - 7 for a total of 3 rinses.

    - [ ] Rinse 1
    - [ ] Rinse 2
    - [ ] Rinse 3

8. Remove the final DI water rinse.
9. Place the tubes in a 40¬∞C oven overnight to dry.
