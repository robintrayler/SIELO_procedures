# Mixing Ca-Acetate Buffered Acetic Acid

I've set the example up as if I am mixing two 500 mL solutions, one 2 M acetic acid solution and 1 unknown Ca-Acetate solution. The final volume is 1000 mL for 1 molar acetic acid.



* pH = 4.5
* pKa (acetic acid) = 4.76
* Final Volume = 1L 
* Final acid molarity (1 M)
* base = acetate, [base] = Ca-acetate concentration
* acid = acetic acid, [acid] = acid concentration

$$[base] = \frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}$$

Where Z is moles of acetate.  

$$[acid] = \frac{500~mL\times 2~M}{1000~mL}$$


Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch equation

$$pH = pKa + log_{10}(\frac{[base]}{[acid]})$$

$$4.5 = 4.76 + log_{10} (\frac{[\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}]}{[\frac{500~mL\times 2~M}{1000~mL}]]})$$

$$4.5 = 4.76 + log_{10} ([\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}]) -log_{10}( {[\frac{500~mL\times 2~M}{1000~mL}]})$$

$$4.5 = 4.76 + log_{10} ([\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}]) -log_{10}(1)$$

$$4.5 = 4.76 + log_{10} ([\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}]) - 0$$

$$4.5 - 4.76 = log_{10} ([\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}])$$

$$-0.26 = log_{10} ([\frac{500~mL\times Z}{1000~mL}])$$

$$10^{-0.26} = (0.5 \times Z)$$

$$0.55 = 0.5 \times Z$$

$$1.1 = Z$$ 

So we need a 1.1 moles acetate solution to buffer a solution of 1 M acetic acid. Since Ca-Acetate has 2 moles of acetate per mole Ca-acetate we need 0.55 moles of Ca-Acetate.

Converting to useful units, 

$$0.55 * Molar~mass~of~Ca~acetate~anhydrous$$
$$0.55 * 178 g/Mole = 97.9 g~Ca~acetate$$
