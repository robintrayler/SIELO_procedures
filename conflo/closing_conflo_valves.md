## Introduction

Before loading samples or otherwise opening the *Costech 4010 Elemental Combustion System* or the *ThermoFisher TC/EA* **you must** isolate the mass spectrometer from the peripheral instruments. Failure to do so can ruin analyses and cause significant damage to the mass spectrometer. 

## Instructions

In *Isodat Acquisition* scroll down to find the `Conflo IV Diagnosis` panel in the sidebar. Toggle all valves and capillaries off by clicking all green radio buttons. Note that one value under `Sample Dilution` will always remain open and Isodat will not allow it to be turned off. This ensures that the *Conflo IV* sample open split maintains a helium atmosphere.
